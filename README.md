# Summary
<p>This two-level platformer prototype, created to learn Unity basics, includes simple mechanics: jumping between platforms, transitioning between levels, and restarting the game upon failure. The first level introduces players to platform navigation, while the second adds slightly tougher jumps, testing timing and precision.

With a focus on Unity's core 2D tools, this project explores essentials like physics, level transitions, and basic scripting. Though minimal, it provides a foundation for expanding into a more complex game in the future.</p>
